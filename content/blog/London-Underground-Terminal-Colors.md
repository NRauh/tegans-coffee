Like the Tube? Like using a terminal? Like nice colors for that terminal? Well you're in luck! Because Transport for London's official colors make a nice theme for your terminal (mostly).

When I gathered the colors, TfL had two relevant color guides online. One for the London Underground, and one for general TfL stuff (Colour Standard issue 4). The dark colors come from the general guide, and the light colors come from Underground line guide. They greys and background were from the color standards guide (because there were loads more).

There is a couple things to note, some of the light values needed more contrast, so were modified slightly. Also, the dark green color uses the Tram color rather than District Line, because the District's green was clashed too much. One or two of these colors also is a default to iTerm that I didn't want to change.

Here are the colors

If your terminal doesn't have those colors, just skip it.

For added fun, use the font Source Code Pro.
